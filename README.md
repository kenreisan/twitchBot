Hello everyone, kenrei here!

This is a project for my twitch channel, is coded ugly I know. But I start to getting rusted from not code in a long time.
My native language isn't english so i beg for your forgiveness, it will improve and this is a way to be better at it.

So, no much information here uh! Well just let say that is a bot for Twitch that starts a game of Monster Hunter, a basic one,
it only selects a monster randomly and then yiu can attack him with a dice of 6, and thats it. No big deal, but i hope it will
improve over time.

If you reach this line, and have a little of spare time, please sendme a message to my twiter account: @kenreisan and tell me if
if you understand what i try to say in this readme. 

Thanks a lot!
